# Differences-in-Salary-Among-Employees

This project uses various SQL functions to explore a mulitnational organization's database to determine the differences that exist among its employees in terms of salary. Using the company's `staff` database, this analysis will attempt to answer the following questions.

* Which region pays the highest salary?

* Is there a gap in salaries based on gender? Is the gender wage gap, to the extent that it exists, consistent with years of service?

* Are the gender wage gaps consistent across all locations?

* For each department, is there a substantial gap between the highest and lowest earners in terms of salary and length of service?

The database used in this analysis was created using this script. The database contains three tables which provide various information about the company's  employees, including name, gender, department and division they work in, the country and region they work, hire date and salary.
